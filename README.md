# Elysium

Helping us remember those no longer with us.

Some key commands so I don't forget:

**Build the docker image for ARM64 arch and push to the github registry**
    
    `docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t "ghcr.io/nick-ducker/<container>:<release>" . --push`

**Restart the deployment so k8s will pull the new image**

    `kubectl rollout restart deploy <name>`

**Figure out which port the dang thing is running on**

    `kubectl get svc <deployment name>`

**Update the helm deployment**

    `helm upgrade elysium ./elysium`
